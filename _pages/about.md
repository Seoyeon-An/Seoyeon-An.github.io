Hello, welcome to my GitHub blog!

I’m a Master’s student at Yonsei University in the Republic of Korea, currently pursuing studies in Statistics and Data Science. Prior to this, I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Applied Statistics from Yonsei University. I'm affiliated with the [ITML](https://itml.yonsei.ac.kr/home) lab within the Department of Statistics and Data Science. 

My research interests includes `Theory of Machine Learning`, more specifically about `Efficient Machine Learning` and `Theoretical Understanding of the Foundation Models`.

Feel free to explore my blog and connect with me through email or linkedin listed in bottom, for discussions, collaborations, or any inquiries!
